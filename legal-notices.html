                This website is not intended to create an attorney-client relationship between you and Covenant. You cannot
                establish an attorney-client relationship with us by sending us confidential information related to you and/or your
                company unless we have expressly authorized the submission of such information in an e-mail or other written
                authorization. We cannot represent you until we know that doing so will not create a conflict of interest. If you
                provide any unsolicited information to us through the website, it will not preclude us from representing another
                client directly adverse to you.

                references. Any representative matters and other experience included herein should not imply current or former client
                status. You should not rely on any information contained herein, in particular any reference to
                representative matters and other experience, in making any decision, taking any action or refraining from taking any
                action. Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome.
